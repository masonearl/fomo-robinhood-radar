"""Read the chain as it happens, and say so the moment a burst forms.

The fifteen-minute pass reads the last 200k blocks every time it runs, which is the right shape
for a tape that must not have holes in it and the wrong shape for an alert. FLYBRAIN's eight
wallets went in between 20:10 and 20:18; the pass that noticed finished at 20:35. Blocks land every
tenth of a second on this chain, and everything the roster did in the last twenty seconds is two
`eth_getLogs` over two hundred blocks — cheaper than one page of the site.

So this loop asks for only the blocks it has not seen, writes whatever fills they hold through
the same `insert_trade` as everything else (the fill key makes the overlap with the fifteen-minute
pass harmless), and runs the burst rule on every tick. It keeps no state across restarts on
purpose: a gap of a minute or an hour is exactly what the fifteen-minute pass exists to fill.

The RPC is the one shared resource. Two processes each allowed 45 requests a minute is 90 against
an endpoint that already answers 429 to 45 now and then, so this one runs on a smaller allowance
of its own.
