"""On-chain tracking: pull swaps for tracked wallets.

Sources are tried in the order given by TRACK_SOURCES; the first one that supports the
wallet's chain wins:

  rpc     - Robinhood Chain only, free and keyless: two eth_getLogs calls against the chain's
            own public endpoint cover the whole roster, whatever its size.
  trenches- Robinhood Chain only, free and keyless: one tape request covers every wallet in a
            pass, but only for the ~108 wallets that site curates.
  codex   - every chain we watch (solana/base/robinhood), returns USD per trade.
            Costs >=1 request per wallet per pass out of 10k/month, so keep
            TRACK_MAX_WALLETS_PER_PASS and the loop interval sane.
  helius  - Solana only, needs HELIUS_API_KEY. Free tier is 1M credits/month and an
            Enhanced Transactions call costs 100 credits, i.e. ~10k calls/month.

A wallet whose chain no source supports is counted in `unsupported` and left alone.
