"""Answer two questions against the watchlist: what do we know about this token, and this trader.

The database already holds who is good, what they hold and what they bought. These read it back the
way a person asks: point at a contract address and ask whose money is in it, or point at a handle
and ask what that person is actually doing. Nothing here calls an API.

The measure that matters for a token is not how many wallets hold it but *whose*. One trader
scoring 85 says more than ten scoring 40, so holder quality is summed as (score/100)^2 — squaring
