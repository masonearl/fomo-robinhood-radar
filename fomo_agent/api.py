"""HTTP API over the watchlist — the one brain the site, the bot and any future client read from.

Everything the product knows already lives in `pipeline/analyze.py`; this exposes it over HTTP so
the Astro front end can render pages on the server and so a third party can eventually build on it.
No business logic lives here: a route reads a query string, calls the same function the terminal
calls, and returns the dict. Anything else would be a second definition of the truth.

One thing it does add: a token nobody on the watchlist has touched is still a fair question. Rather
than answering "unknown", the token route falls back to a live DexScreener lookup, stores what comes
back, and says plainly that no tracked wallet is in it. That is the difference between a list and a
tool.
