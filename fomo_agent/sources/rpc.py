"""Robinhood Chain's own public JSON-RPC as a wallet-trade source — free, keyless, unmetered.

Codex charges roughly one request per wallet per pass, which is what makes its 10k/month budget the
binding constraint on this whole project. The chain's public endpoint gives the same fills for
nothing, because `eth_getLogs` accepts a *list* of values for a topic position: one request asks
"every ERC-20 Transfer whose receiver is any of these 300 wallets", a second asks the same for the
sender, and together they cover the entire roster however large it grows.

How a fomo trade looks on chain 4663 (measured Sep 2026):

  * A relayer submits the transaction; the trader's wallet is never its `from`. Every fill is
    routed through one contract, and the wallet's only leg is the token arriving from it (a buy) or
    leaving to it (a sell). Filtering on that counterparty separates real fills from the airdrops
    and plain transfers that make up most of a wallet's log traffic.
  * Exactly one fill per transaction, so the trade's size is unambiguous: it is the WETH moved
    inside that transaction, and the wallet's own token leg gives the direction.
  * Blocks land every ~0.1s. The configured 200k-block lookback spans ~5.6 hours.
    Split its log requests into at most 30,000 inclusive blocks (the observed endpoint limit),
    keeping the full lookback. Timestamps are interpolated from two probes.

Requests are rate-limited: the endpoint starts returning 429 long before it returns bad data. It
also rejects the default httpx user agent outright, hence RPC_USER_AGENT.
